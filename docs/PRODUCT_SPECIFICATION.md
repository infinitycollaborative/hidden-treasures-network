## 1. Genesis of the Network & Ownership

### 1.1 The Hidden Treasures Concept - Origin Story

The Hidden Treasures Network represents the evolution of a grassroots vision into a comprehensive global education platform. The concept has its roots in the collaborative spirit of aviation education and the mentorship relationships that define the industry.

#### Bruce Blaska's Original Concept (2016)

Bruce Blaska, a certified aviation education leader with Gleim Aviation and a Marine Corps veteran helicopter pilot, first conceptualized the networking approach in 2016. As a spiritual brother-in-arms, board advisor to Infinity Aero Club, mentor, and close friend to Ricardo Foster, Bruce shared his extensive network of friends, clients and individuals within the STEM and aviation world. He wanted everyone to network and facilitate connections among various aviation and STEM organizations, encouraging programs to share ideas, resources to enhance their outreach efforts.

#### Ricardo Foster's Evolution & Ownership (2020-Present)

While Bruce Blaska conceptualized the sharing and networking approach, Ricardo Foster embraced the idea and evolved it as a grassroots best practice and lessons learned concept approached learned from his military experience to mean what it means today. From 2020-2025, Ricardo built his own grassroots network through:

- Direct community engagement across Tampa Bay, Florida
- National touring to the West Coast and throughout the United States
- International expansion to Jamaica, Guyana, and Caribbean nations
- Workshops, summer camps, and educational outreach programs with NGOs and GOs
- Girls in Aviation Day events and Aviation Merit Badge Days

#### The "Hidden Treasures" Philosophy

Ricardo named the children and youth reached through his programs "Hidden Treasures" - recognizing their untapped potential waiting to be discovered. The name reflects the core belief that every young person contains extraordinary value and capability that simply needs the right environment, mentorship, and opportunity to emerge.

### 1.2 Formal Ownership Structure

**Ricardo "Tattoo" Foster, LCDR USN (Ret.)** holds complete ownership of the Hidden Treasures Network DBA, as part of Infinity Aero Club Tampa Bay, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 What This Platform Does

Hidden Treasures Network is a **holistic identity, purpose discovery, and aviation/STEM education platform** that transforms individuals from the inside out. The platform connects underserved youth, veterans, educators, mentors, organizations, and sponsors in a unified ecosystem designed to break financial and systemic barriers to aviation, STEM careers, and entrepreneurship.

#### Core Philosophy

> "You can't build a career on an unstable foundation."

Before pushing students toward certifications and careers, the platform guides them through a transformational journey addressing **Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual dimensions**—discovering the "hidden treasure" within themselves.

### 2.2 The Problem We're Solving

#### Industry Crisis

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **34,000** | New pilots needed annually through 2040 - critical shortage |
| **3.5M** | STEM jobs unfilled by 2025 - skills gap widening |
| **3-3.9%** | Black pilots in U.S. aviation - underserved communities locked out |
| **1.4M** | STEM worker deficit projected by 2030 (U.S.) |

#### The Representation Gap

- **Black workers:** 11% of workforce, only 9% of STEM
- **Hispanic workers:** 17% of workforce, only 8% of STEM
- **Women:** 50% of workforce, only 35% of STEM
- **Nonwhite school districts** receive $23B less funding despite serving same number of students

> **The untapped talent exists. What's missing is the infrastructure to unlock it.**

## 3. The Three Career Pillars

Hidden Treasures Network offers three distinct career pathways, each designed to guide participants from first exposure through career launch.

### 3.1 AVIATION Track - "From Discovery Flight to Dream Career"

The Aviation track takes participants from the first flight of a drone or aircraft to commercial certification. The industry needs 34,000 new pilots annually, yet only 16% of U.S. pilots are Black, Brown, or Women combined—leaving underserved communities locked out of high-wage airline careers. This pillar directly bridges that gap, creating pathways from discovery flight to the flight deck.

| Tier | Key Benefits | Price |
|------|--------------|-------|

### 3.2 STEM Track - "From Curiosity to Creation"

The STEM track builds technical skills progressively, from fundamental concepts through advanced applications. Aligned with the 1.4M STEM worker deficit projected by 2030, this pillar creates a direct pipeline to high-wage technical careers.

| Tier | Key Benefits | Price |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **PROTOTYPE** | Profile creation, intro STEM courses (coding basics, robotics 101), community forum | FREE |

### 3.3 ENTREPRENEURSHIP Track - "From Idea to Empire"

The Entrepreneurship track leverages our AI-driven platform suite—WhiteSpaceAI, BridgeSpace, BlueSpace Gap Finder, and the AI Startup Factory's Entrepreneurial Assembly Line™—to guide participants from idea to empire, with the potential to create 50,000 new business owners from underserved communities.

| **IDEATION** | Profile creation, intro business courses, financial literacy basics, entrepreneur stories | FREE |
| **VALIDATE** | Full business course library, business plan templates, mentor matching, pitch competitions | $99/year |
